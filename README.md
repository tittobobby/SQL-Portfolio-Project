# SQL-Portfolio-Project


This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the process of cleaning and transforming earthquake data using MySQL. 

The goal is to document the steps involved in preparing the data for analysis, with a focus on using the MySQL database management system.

Dataset is taken from Kaggle : "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserhessein/earthquake-dataset"

It begins by using the "USE" command to switch to a specific database within the MySQL server, and continues by executing various SQL statements to manipulate and standardize the data in the "earthquake" table. 

The process includes selecting and displaying data, altering table structures, updating and replacing values, and using functions such as STR_TO_DATE() and CAST() to standardize the date and time columns.

The goal of this project is to ensure that the data in the "earthquake" table is clean and ready for further analysis.
